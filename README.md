## Introduction

Nuxt is an excellent tool for building full-stack applications based on Vue. It has a diverse ecosystem with hundreds of great libraries for anything you need. However, being forced to make so many choices can be overwhelming.

Vue is very flexible, you can write Vue applications in any way you like, but that flexibility comes with a cost. Since no pre-defined architecture developers can follow, it often leads to messy, inconsistent, or over-complicated codebases. 

Nuxt calls itself an intuitive framework. Nuxt provides a framework for building a full-stack application with a front-end built in Vue and a different back-end. It offers a lot, but developers still need to make many decisions, such as authentication or testing mechanisms.

This repository presents a way of creating Nuxt applications using the best tools in the ecosystem with a good project structure that scales very well. It is based on the experience of working with many different codebases, and this architecture is the most effective one.

This repo aims to serve as a collection of resources and sound practices when developing Nuxt applications. It is supposed to showcase solving most of the real-world problems of an application practically and help developers write better applications.

Feel free to explore the codebase to get the most value from the repo.
